# credit-risk-classification

In this Challenge you are asked to train and evaluate a model based on its performance in detecting loan risk based on the following instructions. 

Instructions: 

1-Create a repository named credit-risk-classification on Github. 
2- Read in the data from the lending_data csv file. 
3- Assign the "loan_status" column to the y variable and assign the remaining columns to the X variable. 
4- Split the data into training and testing datasets using sklearn's train_test_split module.  
4- Fit a logistic regression model with the training sets, x_train and y_train. 
5- Make predictions usin the fitted model and the testing dataset and save your predictions to a variable. 
6- Evaluate the performance of your model making a confusion matrix and a classification report, print the report. 
7- Write a credit risk analysis report containing an overview of the purpose of the analysis, a bulleted list that outlines the accuracy, precision and recall scores of the model and that summarizes the key results from the machine learning model. Your justification for recommending or not recommending the model must be included in your analysis.
